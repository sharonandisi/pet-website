        <h1>A lil something about Robin</h1>
        <h2>Shaolin Ninja in Disguise</h2>
        <p>This is the story about a lil guy named Robin.
            Let's just say he is a lot more than meets the eye</p>
        <p>Robin is a west highland white terrier. 
            Commonly known as a westie</p>
        <p>Robin's kind of breed is originally from Scotland. They are specifically known to be :
            <ol>
                <li>intelligent</li>
                <li>quick to learn</li>
                <li>good with children . 
                    Althugh since they are quite intolerant to rough handling some arent quite friendly to children cause kids tend to pull on dog ears. Therefore a good number of terriers prefer solitude</li>
                <li>intolerant to rough handling</li>
                <li>active</li>
                <li>social with a high prey drive as they once used to hunt rodents</li>
            </ol>

        </p>
